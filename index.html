                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" id="par1">
                    The extraordinary life of Dr Sanjay Gupta has been no less than a Fairy Tale where there are hardships, struggles, a bit of luck, hard work, determination and above all faith in Almighty as well as in one‚Äôs own capabilities. A true living example of transforming adversity into opportunity, Dr Gupta has risen from a humble beginning to become an eminent entrepreneur of the country today.
<br>
<br>
Born in 1965 at Kasturba Gandhi Hospital, Delhi, Dr. Gupta started his entrepreneurial journey with meagre means. Eldest among four siblings, he would repair watches, make candles, sell them till midnight on a footpath at Chandni Chowk, Delhi and his entire family lived in a 6‚Äôx9‚Äô room in the same area. His father used to repair watches on a footpath in the same area. Since there was not enough space at his home for everyone to even sleep properly, Dr. Gupta would spend his nights on the footpath.
<br>
<br>
Obviously those were very hard days for his family and to make both ends meet he would also work as a peon for the shopkeepers during the day ‚Äì cleaning the shops, bringing tea or water or doing their petty jobs. Later in 1981, he started to repair scooters while continuing his studies through correspondence. In the meanwhile he continued with several small businesses like selling audio cassettes and supplying video cassettes on rent. He would walk for 3- 4 miles every day to deliver video cassettes to his clients. Despite so muchof labour, he was not able to earn enough to support his family properly. Always in the search of finding new means of income to provide for the family he ventured into the business of buying cheap watches, cassettes and other small articles to sell them at low profit.
<br>
<br>
Gradually, he bought a small shop in Old Delhi‚Äôs Lajpat Rai market in 1990 on loan but he had to face many problems to repay the loan. When it was time to pay the loan interest amount he had no money so he asked one of his acquaintances to lend him five thousand rupees, who in return asked him to
<br>
<br>
keep a photo of Sai Baba in his shop. Subsequently, things started to get a little better but the struggle still continued. At one time he was almost on the verge of giving up but his unflinching faith in himself and his own capabilities did not let difficulties overpower his endurance. With all his might and determination he persistently kept moving towards his goal. Finally, his hard work paid off and his business started picking up and thereafter there was no looking back for him. While he started earning enough to survive well he also saved money for future investments to have a regular income.
                    
                    Most of his well-wishers suggested him to open a hospital or construct a banquet hall where there were quick and immediate financial returns. But he had different plans. He had always thought of giving back to the society ‚Äì he wanted to serve mankind by fulfilling his dream of opening a school for children. Since he couldn‚Äôt get a chance to go to school himself and enjoy the real teaching and learning environment, he knew the importance of school in the life of a child. He knew that quality education plays a major role in bringing a difference to one‚Äôs life. He stayed committed to the cause and started with the process of opening a school in 1993 which finally materialized in 2005.
<br>
<br>
Today he is the proud owner of a vast empire - The Ramagya Group - comprising of Ramagya Group of Schools (six schools) ranked amongst top 30 schools in India by Forbes, Ramagya Sports Academy which is one of the top 10 Sports Academies in India, and Ramagya Institute which is also ranked as one of the top 15 Institutes in India by India Today Group. Besides, the Ramagya Group encompasses Ramagya First Step (Day Care), Ramagya Roots (Pre Schools), Ramagya Foundation (an NGO that has served over 11 lakh people under its 12 programmes), Baal Saathee (a Student Health Programme), Knowledge Vista (an online learning portal), Ruchika Sales Corporation (an import export company) and Nishabd (a dog shelter), among others.
<br>
<br>
Precisely Ramagya Foundation primarily focuses on the needs of education of the less privileged, extending the horizon by addressing the needs of the larger community. It is through Nishabd that Ramagya Foundation has been engaged in raising voice for the voiceless and it has successfully treated and fed over 175000 dogs since its inception. Ramagya Foundation has also come forward to feeding 11 lakh migrant labourers and poor people during the recent COVID-19 lock down period. As the country has been facing the second devastating wave of COVID-19, Ramagya Foundation has dedicated itself to provide critical
<br>
<br>
                    medical support to those battling with the disease across Noida, Greater Noida in Delhi-NCR region. Under the visionary leadership of Dr. Gupta, Ramagya Foundation has launched an all-out initiative to provide oxygen concentrators and cylinders, medical equipment and ventilators as well as free ambulance services for the needy with the aim to provide timely medical assistance to people. Ramagya Foundation has associated with the local administration to carry out this welfare initiative.
<br>
<br>
A visionary entrepreneur Dr. Sanjay Gupta says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to wait but more difficult to regret and so never give up on something you really want. Life is neither a surprise nor a miracle for all and only the ones who do not give up on their dreams against all odds become the torch bearers for others.‚Äù
<br>
<br>
With his heart full of compassion, Dr Gupta has left no stone unturned and no opportunity slip through his fingers to reveal his magnanimous side. He has been continuously serving the underprivileged section of the society by extending support to a large number of people across all age groups in the form of free education, skill development, besides providing employment and much more. Moreover, he has got constructed 200 flats under the name of SaiChhaya Developers Pvt Ltd and delivered them to the poor and disadvantaged.
<br>
<br>
Dr Sanjay Gupta with the potential to excel and the desire to succeed has accomplished marvellous feats. A lot of prestigious awards and recognitions from renowned institutes of the country were bestowed upon him and the Ramagya Group. Dr. Sanjay Gupta was accorded Honorary Doctorate Degree on 4th May 2014 in Kuala Lumpur by The Open International University for Complementary Medicines, Srilanka, Asia Pacific Achievers Award in May 2014, Award for Extraordinary Contribution in Education by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Shri Yogi Adityanath and Chairman Zee News, Mr Subhash Chandra and ‚ÄòTimes Power Icon Award‚Äô for exemplary contribution in the field of education and to the growth of Indian Economy.
<br>
<br>
Under the astute leadership of Dr. Gupta, Ramagya School has won a series of awards and recognitions which comprise the much prestigious ranking among Top 30 Great Indian Schools by Forbes India and it has been ranked 4 in the ‚ÄòBest School‚Äô category in Noida by the Times of India, besides being awarded a wide bouquet of awards including ‚ÄòBest School using Technology‚Äô by ISA (Dubai), ‚ÄòLeading School in NCR for Innovative Curriculum and Academic Excellence‚Äô by World Education Summit.

                  The entire world is currently trying to come to terms with COVID-19 which has unleashed an unprecedented crisis. Besides widespread sufferings and loss of jobs, the pandemic has significantly disrupted the education sector. But we had to find ways and means to cope with it as the famous German Aviator ‚ÄúDieter F. Uchtdorf‚Äù has rightly said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your life‚Äôs story will develop.‚Äù
                    <br>
                    <br>
                   The COVID-19 crisis and the imposition of lockdown to contain the spread of the pandemic have altogether brought the whole world to a standstill. While the people have been facing various challenges like uncertainty, insecurity and the fear of the unknown, the Children have been the worst sufferers during the COVID-19 induced lockdown.  
<br>
<br>
Their schools are closed and they are confined to their homes for no fault of their own. Amid this unprecedented scenario, the schools had to rethink over the strategies to keep the educational ball rolling and the entire management and the teachers have participated and contributed their bit to keep the children energetic and enthusiastic. 
<br>
<br>
Ramagya School, which remains engaged in looking for different avenues and activities that promote mental health and physical wellbeing, quickly envisioned the forthcoming impact of lockdown on its young learners and kick-started online classes right from the first day of ‚ÄòLockdown 1‚Äô  i.e. from 24th March 2020. Our objective was simply to keep the students occupied, hopeful and thrilled for their future.  
<br>
<br>                    
However, the journey of online classes has not been so easy, as there were many glitches since Day 1. First of all, we had to choose a safe platform to conduct our live classes and going forward we had to also deal with the internet problems faced by our students who were located in their hometowns. We had to also train the teachers on how to use online teaching methods efficiently. But throughout all the processes, we were determined to solve all the issues efficiently.  
<br>
<br> 
Amid all these, whenever we faced challenges, we framed them in words with simultaneously expressing our hopes and dreams alongside. Both these words became our source of inspiration in the discovery of new methods of teaching and learning during the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic. The education industry did not look for excuses and reasons to shut down. In a matter of weeks, the fast-spreading COVID-19 pandemic changed how students get education all around the globe. Meanwhile, the pandemic also offered us an opportunity to explore new ways to impart education in times of adversity.  
<br>
<br>
Although these changes were not easy to adapt, they have undoubtedly paved the way to achieve new milestones in the education sector. Considering the importance and urgency of conducting online classes, the teachers left no stone unturned while teaching their students online. The diligence and dedication with which each teacher worked to make online classes successful is commendable and incomparable.  
<br>
<br>
The solidarity and professionalism of teachers have touched a new high and it would not be wrong to say that our teachers of the present times are the unsung ‚Äòheroes‚Äô who have helped the education industry survive during the pandemic.
